    <body>
        <p> I've lived in a bunch of different places. Not because of my parents
            moving me from place to place, but because I like to live in different places.</p> 
            <h3>Places I've lived<h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Hawk Point, MO - 18 years</li>
                    <li>Kansas City, MO - 3.5 years</li>
                    <li>Ft. Madison, IA - 1.5 year</li>
                    <li>St. Louis, MO - 6 months</li>
                    <li>Chicago, IL - 2 years</li>
                    <li>St. Louis, MO - 2 years</li>
                </ol>
        <p> In all of these places I've lived except for the first, I've only lived in the same
            place for a 1 year period maximum. I have, however, just moved into a house and I 
            plan on living there for quite some time.</p>
