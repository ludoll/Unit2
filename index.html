        <p> I've lived in a bunch of different places. Not because of my parents
            moving me from place to place, but because I like to live in different places.</p>

            <h3>Places I've lived<h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Hawk Point, MO - 18 years</li>
                    <li>Kansas City, MO - 3.5 years</li>
                    <li>Ft. Madison, IA - 1.5 years</li>
                    <li>St. Louis, MO - 6 months</li>
                    <li>Chicago, IL - 2 years</li>
                    <li>St. Louis, MO - 2 years</li>
                </ol>
        <p> In all of these places I've lived except for the first, I've only lived in the same
            place for a 1 year period maximum. I have, however, just moved into a house and I 
            plan on living there for quite some time.</p>

        <p> in 2013 I met my wife Amy. She got a job in Chicago and I followed her there. We were married
            in 2016 and she is the reason I now live in a house I plan on staying at for a long time.</p>
        <article>I work for a company called Tee Turtle in a warehouse. My main job is to train all of the 
            new hires and provide them all of the knowledge they will need to succeed as well as a 
        reference source if they have any questions about what to do in a given situation.</article>
